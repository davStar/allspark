Allspark is a Docker based developer toolbox fully automated in term of configuration and parameterization between the different developpment tool stacks.

## About Allspark

Allspark has been initiated and created inside the actinium organization. As allspark has a new sponsor we have forked the original actinium\allspark to the new organisation sponsor lightpharos\allspark-neo .

actinium\allspark and lightpharosio\allspark-neo have the same objectives to provide a multi hosting DevOPS pipeline platform.
Neo provides an architecture evolution of the allspark product. Indeed actinium\allspark provides in one box a full stack contenerized. This solution is relevant for testing the platform automation and what the service can provide in one VM.
However we aim with neo to provide a better scalability by splitting the stack in different VM using for instace cloud automation script based on terraform.
Finally in a specific release of Neo we also aim to increase the level of agnosticity and scalability by using K8s docker orchestration system.
