Allspark is a Docker based developer toolbox fully automated in term of configuration and parameterization between the different developpment tool stacks.

## About Allspark

Allspark is a devops pipeline including forge components (Gitlab, Jenkins, SonarQube...). Managing all these components could be a brain teaser. Allspark has the objectives to reduce forge integration, management complexity, improve hosting agnosticity and providing multi tenancy approach.  

Allspark targets 3 types of implementation accross 3 subproducts:
1. OneBox (**Available Under stabilization**) ==> For Small Businesses
2. ElasticSparks (**not initiated**) ==> The ideal choice for IaaS hosting services.
3. Kubsparks (**not initiated**) ==> An implementation compatible with Kubernete.

Allspark has been initiated and created inside the actinium organization. As the "core" dev team navigate to new horizon the project moved to a new organization. However we thanks them #Xide and #Guiadco for their contribution and passion. 

Allspark is now part of lightpharosio. Long live to allspark ! :)
